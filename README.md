# Data_Professionals_Survey
Visualizing data with PowerBI

In this project, I analyzed data gotten from an online survey and put the insights gotten into a visualization. 
From the visualization one can see that:
* 630 person participated in the survey and the average age of the participants was approximately 30.
* Python is the preferred programming language. 
* 24.78% of the participants found it difficult to break into data while 42.7% found it neither easy or difficult to break into data
